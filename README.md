## Description
This data mining project analyzes an IMDb dataset containing information on movies, TV series, and other audiovisual content. Our goal is to extract significant insights through techniques such as **preprocessing, clustering, classification, regression, and pattern mining**.

## Project Contents
The project follows a structured flow, divided into several phases:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Understanding and Preparation**
- Semantic data analysis  
- Descriptive statistics and variable distribution  
- Data cleaning and transformation  
- Correlation analysis and feature selection  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Clustering**
- **K-Means** and **Bisecting K-Means**  
- **DBSCAN**  
- **Hierarchical clustering**  
- Final comparison between techniques  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Classification**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **Na√Øve Bayes (Gaussian and Categorical)**  
- **Decision Trees** with pre-pruning and post-pruning  
- Performance analysis with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Two excellent classifiers were built with accuracies of **86%** and **90%**  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Regression**
- **Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso**  
- **Decision Tree Regression and KNN Regression**  
- **Analysis of the most significant variables**  
- **Multivariate regression**  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Pattern Mining**
- Extraction of frequent patterns with **FP-Growth**  
- **Association rules** with support and confidence  
- Analysis of the most significant rules to predict the type of content  

## üìä Main Results
- **K-Means (k=7)** provided the best clustering compared to other techniques.  
- **Decision Trees** achieved the highest accuracy for classification.  
- **KNN Regression** showed the best predictive capability for regression.  
- **Pattern Mining** revealed significant associations between duration, genre, and geographical distribution of titles.

- **Language**: Python üêç  
- **Main libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `mlxtend`  
- **Notebook**: Jupyter
